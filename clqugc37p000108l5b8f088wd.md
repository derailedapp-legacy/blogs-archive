As 2023 has now come to a close, I need to set my vision for Wētā Games for 2024, as I did in 2022 for 2023. None of this is *fully* set in stone yet, meaning things in here can change at any time, be it small tweaks, or their existence overall.

So, without further ado, let's get started right into 2024.

# A Short Recap of Q4 2023

The last half of 2023 has been quite a turbulent run for Wētā. We've done from Derailed, to Stardevil, and now here.

Around early October, I started exploring a games division for the former Anavereum organization (this would eventually turn into the Derailed organization,) and by late October Derailed Games had been established.

Around early-mid September Derailed Chat had already been discontinued in favor of future organizational efforts towards Derailed Games. Also in September, Derailed Games became Stardevil Games to express more uniqueness.

In early December, work on Agent had already begun, and Stardevil Games turned into Wētā Games to better emphasize what we wanted to make.

# Wētā Games Presents: Agent

As we told all of you back on Christmas day, Agent will be the first game in Wētā's aim for high-quality story-driven video games.

Agent takes place on the fictional island of San Lakas, based on Western Mindanao in the Philippines. The game takes place on five fictional cities, with one temporarily explorable city based in Geu Dosi, Aurora (based on Seoul, South Korea.)

It is a 2D pixel-based action game with an open world. The game is almost like Mario with guns. You can sprint, as well as fight and dodge enemies.

In Agent, you play Andrew, a government agent in the Philippines, part of the Centralized Organization of Philippine Security (COPS, or the "Agency.")

He was orphaned at 5 years old and has been part of the Agency since 1999. Now in 2024, he has to save the people around him as the corrupt Philippine government and the Agency collapse.

# Arriving 2025: Wētā Chat

In late 2024, we will be starting a project called Wētā Chat. It is a business-oriented chat app, trying to improve upon all of Slack's faults. It will feature tiered channels, improved APIs, the same if not easier support for integrations, categorized category channels, calendar tracking, and much more.

We hope to deliver this service to businesses by late 2025. It will be a paid-only service with a possible trial-like free version, although with imposed limitations. Unlike Derailed Chat, Wētā Chat is only oriented towards businesses, not communities.

We hope to provide all of you with more information about it in mid-2024.

# An Awesome 2023

It has been an awesome 2023, with so many things done over that time, and so many lessons learned. We hope 2024 will be even better, especially with the release of Agent, and foundational work on Wētā Chat.

And a special thank you to you, for helping make all of this possible.

Until 2024, have a great rest of your day, Vincent, President of Wētā Games.
