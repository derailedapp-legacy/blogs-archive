## State of the Platform for September 2022

Welcome! This is Derailed's State of the Platform for September 2022.

## Little Catchup
If you don't know what the state of the platform is, it was a program started by me in May for what at the time was named Venera.

State of the Platform is supposed to give insight into the newest features and news of the platform for the month and our roadmap. Think of it as a changelog for last month and a roadmap for the next month combined basically.

# What's been happening at Derailed
Now, we have a lot of catching up to do here. Our last State of the Platform was for June, so this will be displaying what's happened since then.

- Rewrite

Derailed had a rewrite during this time, we wanted to change our focus from scaling to being easier, better, and more lightweight than other platforms.

- Source changing

We changed our model from open to closed to help prevent the number of attacks that could be put onto our systems.

- The Gateway

Before this period, the gateway was mostly a concept. Now, it's an actual project which actually works and which can be used. Amazing, right?

Most of the gateway's features have been documented in our [ekranoplan](https://github.com/derailedapp/ekranoplan).

- Ekranoplan

Derailed started to make an actual design document. Ekranoplan was created to help speed up development for our developers. Every feature goes through the ekranoplan before ending up in our APIs.

- Todo Repository

We also made a repository for pre-ekranoplan phase designs.

You can check it out [here](https://github.com/derailedapp/todo).

## Newest Features at Derailed

- Guilds

Derailed has fully implemented guilds, a Discord Server-like object.

Guilds allow users to interact in their separate communities and *guilds*.

- Tracks

Tracks have been partially implemented. Tracks are Discord Channel-like objects which allow users to talk to each other in groups.

- Relationships

We've fully implemented relationships, a new way to add other users as friends or block them.
Using relationships, you can add people to GCs, and other stuff.

## Derailed Roadmap for September

For September, we hope to finish our implementation of tracks, members, and other features.

Such things would be added in conciliation:

- Messages
- Invites
- etc.
