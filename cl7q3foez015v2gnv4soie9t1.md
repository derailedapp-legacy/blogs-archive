## Derailed's Community Commitment & Our Ideas

Derailed is first and front-most a community-led project. Without our community, derailed wouldn't have been able to have gone this far. The tremendous amount of support has helped us keep going even when it seemed like we couldn't.

Derailed has an underlying commitment to its community to help it out whenever it can. Any struggles, moderation-wise or with mass amounts of trolling or botting, we'll do our damnedest to fix them. We also love going through your suggestions. Several features of Duno have come from community-thought ideas and suggestions, which if planned and executed correctly, are a success for future communities entering the platform.

With that done, I'd love to have a little time to explain some of the ideas we've been thinking of for the future of Derailed. This isn't a roadmap, these features are also still in the planning phase and can either change or be removed entirely at any time.

## Derailed Bots
Automated bots are essential for functional communities at this point. It's not that humans aren't fast enough, or can't catch it good enough, it's just the possibility of the sheer number of messages. An unlimited amount of messages per second can be sent in a channel, leading to massive amounts of messages and content that a normal human or even multiple can't handle at once. But bots.. they can. Built as machines themselves, they can read events from our gateway such as when a message is created and process it asynchronously (multiple messages at once).

Derailed's API has always been built to be easily wrappable by people for API wrappers since we believe they are essential to our developer community.

## Derailed Posts
Derailed Posts is planned to be a twitter-like space that allows you to create, edit, delete and see posts. It will be our final step to a full social platform that allows you to communicate how you want.

This is still a loosely designed topic and is destined to change but simply:

Derailed Users can create posts on their accounts that will have links like: (derailed.gg/@VincentRPS, #0000 discriminator-based usernames don't need to have a tag.)
Other users can: like/dislike, subscribe to notifications, comment, and generally interact with posts.
They can also follow that user, which would just be an extra relationship (type).

Guilds will also get the threaded option in their settings. There would be three options: dual (both forum-based and track-based), track-only (track-based), forum-only (forum-based)
This will give the option for guilds to be the home for forum-based communities and could open the possibility of entering another social market.

## Decovered
Decovered will become Derailed's top list for guilds, bots, themes, and more.

It will help you discover unfound guilds, bots, themes, and more. We plan for Decovered to become the de-facto board for anything Derailed. It will eventually be open source on [its github](https://github.com/decovered).

For outliers who want to help contribute until then, please contact us [here](mailto:volunteer@derailed.one).

## The wrap-up
And that's it, folks. Another blog is out of the way. btw, if your binge reading these (does that even exist?) in the future, then hi! and hope you enjoy this article.
But until next time, have a good one.
